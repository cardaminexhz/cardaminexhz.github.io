# 125. Valid Palindrome

ref: [Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)

Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.



For example,
&quot;A man, a plan, a canal: Panama&quot; is a palindrome.
&quot;race a car&quot; is not a palindrome.



Note:
Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.
